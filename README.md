# Battery State of Charge (SoC) Estimation

## Overview

This repository contains the code, models, and dataset used for calculating the **State of Charge (SoC)** of battery cells. 
Our approach integrates advanced machine learning techniques to build robust predictive models for accurate battery monitoring.

The repository is structured to help you:

- Calculate **SoC** and **SoH** values from raw battery data.
- Build and train machine learning models based on the provided datasets.
## Features

- **SoC and SoH Estimation**: Code for the estimation of the State of Charge and State of Health values.
- **Model Building**: Step-by-step process of how we built the models to predict SoC values, using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Access to pre-trained models that can be used directly or fine-tuned on other datasets.
- **Datasets**: Battery data used for model training and validation, made available to assist in replicating or extending the work.
